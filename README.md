# Dotfiles
These are my Linux dotfiles managed by [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)

# Running
A makefile is provided that allows for all configurations to be installed or removed using `make` or `make delete` respectively.

# Software
All packages that I install can be found in ``applications.txt``.
